# Nizam Passport API

**Nizam Passport API** is a Laravel package designed to streamline API authentication setup using Laravel Passport. Compatible with Laravel versions 8, 9, 10, and 11, this package simplifies Passport integration by automating the installation and configuration process, making it ideal for API-only projects.

## Features

-   **Automatic Laravel Passport Installation:** Ensures Passport is installed and configured.
-   **API Authentication Scaffolding:** Provides necessary controllers, requests, and routes.
-   **Configuration Updates:** Automatically updates `api.php`, `web.php`, and appends to `auth.php` to use Passport.
-   **User Model Update:** Adds the `HasApiTokens` trait to the User model.
-   **Environment Configuration:** Updates `.env` with default settings.
-   **Auth Configuration Update:** Adds the API guard to the `auth.php` configuration file with the Passport driver if it‚Äôs not already present. This ensures your application uses Passport's TokenGuard for authenticating incoming API requests.
-   **Cleanup:** Removes unnecessary files and directories for API-only applications.

## Requirements

-   **PHP:** ^7.3|^8.0
-   **Laravel:** ^8.0|^9.0|^10.0|^11.0
-   **Laravel Passport:** ^10.0|^11.0|^12.0

    This command will:

    - Clean up unnecessary files and directories

## Usage

This package provides the following API routes:

-   **POST /api/auth/login:** Log in a user
-   **POST /api/auth/logout:** Log out a user (requires authentication)
